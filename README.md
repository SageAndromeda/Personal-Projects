# Poetry Prompts
### Sage Hardiman


### What it Does

This program generates random line-by-line prompts for writing a poem. The user can add their own additional prompts which will be added to the pool of possible options. They then choose how many they wish to see, and the program will randomly select that many unique prompts. There are 50 total prompts to start with, plus however many the user adds for their session.


# How to run

The program must be run via a C++ compiler. If you do not have one, I recommend [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/) which is a free online one. The program first asks you to enter additional prompts you wish to potentially use or type the word `done` to indicate that you are finished writing prompts. User prompts will appear in all capital letters if the program selects them. They will not, however, be saved between sessions of running the program. It will then ask you to enter a number in digits; a string beginning with a number such as `123abc` will successfully read the number. The program then outputs that many unique prompts.

# Inspiration

I was inspired to write this program after creating a poem using [this prompt](https://wewritepoems.wordpress.com/2010/07/01/thursday-prompt-9-line-by-line/). The idea is very similar of several unique but random ideas joined together to make a rough draft that can then be improved upon.
